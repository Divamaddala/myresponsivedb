📊 Responsive Dashboard Application
📌 Objective

This project is a fully responsive web and mobile dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React features implemented directly inside index.html).
The goal is to demonstrate a complete dashboard system that adapts to different devices, integrates charts, supports dark mode, and provides interactive components as per the assignment.

Pie/Donut chart (user demographics).

Recent activity feed.
✅ Mock Data Integration – Data is generated dynamically to simulate real API calls.
✅ Dark Mode – Toggle button switches between light and dark themes.
✅ Settings Form – Allows updating preferences with validation.
✅ Performance Optimization – Code structured to handle updates efficiently.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React concepts inline in index.html)

Charts: Chart.js

State & Data: Mock API simulation with in-memory updates

Design: CSS Grid, Flexbox, media queries for responsiveness

⚠️ Note: In a real-world setup, this project would be modularized with React + Vite + Redux + MirageJS + React Hook Form + TypeScript, but due to constraints, everything is implemented in one index.html file.
